Priority Implementation Order:
=============================

High Priority:
- FundManager (enhances fund analysis)
- AMC (better fund house tracking)
- Benchmark (essential for performance comparison)

Medium Priority:
- FundDividend (income tracking)
- FundNews (keeping users informed)
- FundCategory (better classification)

Low Priority:
- FundComparison (user feature)
- FundAlert (notification system)
- FundDocument (document management)
- MarketData (advanced analytics)

Implementation Notes:
====================
- Each model should follow the established pattern with proper indexes
- Include foreign key relationships to Fund model where appropriate
- Add appropriate constraints and validation
- Consider historical data tracking where relevant
- Ensure scalability for large datasets

Next Steps:
===========
1. Start with high-priority models
2. Create API endpoints for each new model
3. Update data import functionality
4. Add frontend interfaces for new data
5. Create documentation for new endpoints
