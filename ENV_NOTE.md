# Note About Including .env in Git Repository

Normally, it's a best practice to exclude `.env` files from version control as they often contain sensitive information like API keys and passwords. However, in this specific case, we are intentionally including the `.env` file in the repository for the following reasons:

1. **Render.com Deployment**: The `.env` file is being included to facilitate automatic deployment on Render.com, which can automatically detect and use environment variables from this file.

2. **Development Database**: The connection string in the `.env` file points to a development database specifically created for this project.

## Security Considerations

- In a production environment, you should:
  - Generate a new, secure database connection string
  - Set environment variables through the Render dashboard instead of relying on the `.env` file
  - Consider using Render's environment variable encryption features

## Best Practices for Your Own Projects

When adapting this code for your own projects:

1. Create your own `.env` file with your own database credentials
2. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits
3. Set up environment variables on your hosting platform rather than committing sensitive information
